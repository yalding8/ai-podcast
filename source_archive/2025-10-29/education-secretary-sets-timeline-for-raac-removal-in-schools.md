Press release
Education Secretary sets timeline for RAAC removal in schools
Bridget Phillipson wants all schools and colleges to be RAAC-free as she sets timelines for complete removal.
From:
Department for Education
and
The Rt Hon Bridget Phillipson MP
Published
28 October 2025
Every single child in England to be learning in classrooms free from
RAAC
as the Education Secretary sets out timelines for removing Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (
RAAC
) from all schools and colleges- calling time on the crumbling school estate.
The government is rebuilding pride in our education system, setting out plans to permanently remove the dangerous concrete from all schools and colleges with
RAAC
, except those in the School Rebuilding Programme, ahead of the next general election.
For schools with
RAAC
being rebuilt through the School Rebuilding Programme (SRP), all will be in delivery in the same timeframe, with more than half already underway.
The move, part of the government’s plans for national renewal, will help break down barriers to opportunity by removing
RAAC
for good, with more than 42,000 pupils already learning in
RAAC
free classrooms.
Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said:
We inherited a crumbling education estate, but I won’t let that be our legacy.
After years of neglect we are giving every child a safe and high-quality classroom where they can focus on learning - by setting clear timelines for the permanent removal of
RAAC
from schools and colleges. It’s what parents expect, it’s what children deserve and it’s what we are delivering.
It’s about more than just buildings - it’s about showing children that their education matters, their futures matter, and this government is determined to give them the best possible start in life.
There are over 22,000 schools and colleges in England and 237 had confirmed
RAAC
, all of which are providing full time face-to-face education for all pupils. 123 schools with
RAAC
will be rebuilt through the School Rebuilding Programme and 108 schools and colleges are getting government grants for
RAAC
removal, with works delivered through their responsible body – usually the local authority or Trust. Six schools and colleges have alternative arrangements, including buildings not being part of their estate in the longer term.
Last month, the Department for Education updated on progress on
RAAC
removal in schools and colleges in England. Today, the government has confirmed that
RAAC
has been permanently removed from 62 schools and colleges.
It comes following the Department for Education announcing £38 billion in education capital investment over the next five years, taking it to levels not seen since 2010.
