Asian destinations now offer more than 20,000 English-taught programs across 600 ranked universities, boosting the region’s popularity among international students, a new
report
by
Studyportals
and the
British Council
has found.
“The global centre of gravity in higher education is clearly shifting,” said Edwin van Rest, Studyportals CEO and co-founder.
“Asian and MENA universities used to send students abroad. Now they’re keeping them home and attracting students from other regions. Universities need to understand this shift if they want to stay competitive.”
The study, based on data from 51 million prospective students, revealed the steepest rise in demand for Japan and China, with Malaysia, India and Taiwan showing “modest yet positive growth”.
Western universities are also eyeing these regions for TNE opportunities, with Asia attracting the largest share of branch campuses as compared to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Latin America, which the study found to be falling behind.

The notable spike in demand in Asia and MENA seen in January 2024 was likely influenced by policy changes in Canada and the UK coming into effect, suggested Karl Baldacchino, Studyportals researcher and primary author of the report.
Amid Canada
capping
international student numbers and the UK issuing a
ban
on dependants of postgraduate taught courses, “prospective students may have been searching to study closer to home as an alternative option given the perceived risks,” Baldacchino explained.
The search data serves as a stark example of the immediate and powerful impact of policy volatility on student perception, something confirmed by a recent
IDP survey
which warned of sudden and unclear policy changes eroding student trust and shaping international study decisions.
On top of disruptions in traditional anglophone destinations, Baldacchino said “cultural appeal, intra-regional mobility and government initiatives to internationalise higher education” were further reinforcing the trend – one which has been widely
reported on
as international student policies are increasingly at the mercy of rising anti-immigration sentiment across the ‘big four’.
While Asia has seen the steepest rise in demand, education hubs in the Middle East are also gaining international attention, with UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar all launching internationalisation plans including branch campus expansion and fully funded student scholarships designed to draw learners globally.
Across the MENA region, Türkiye and the UAE attracted the highest volume of international student demand, with Baldacchino highlighting the UAE’s growing strength as a TNE hub, guided by its Education 33 (E33) strategy which leverages the country’s international connectivity as an emerging economic powerhouse.
More broadly, the report highlighted the rising demand for online master’s programs in the region, with more universities offering blended and online courses to enhance accessibility and appeal to students that hold either financial or mobility concerns.

Alongside UAE, Baldacchino pointed to India and Malaysia as destinations to watch over the next decade: “Together, these destinations illustrate the next wave of regional education powerhouses driving global student mobility,” he said.
“India is transitioning from a major outbound market to a future inbound hub through ambitious reforms under the National Education Policy 2020 and the attraction of foreign branch campuses.”
On the supply side, India stood out for its notable expansion in both bachelor’s (+55%) and master’s (53%) programs, reflecting the country’s ambitious growth plans and aligning with high student demand for the destination.
In Malaysia, affordable, high-quality education, strong English-taught courses and a clear national internationalisation strategy are contributing to the country’s
growing competitiveness
, seeing a 6% increase in demand across the bachelor’s and master’s levels since 2023.
Contrary to Asia’s steep rise and increased internationalisation in the MENA region, the report laid bare Latin America’s “underdevelopment” as a study destination, sending students abroad but attracting almost none back.
“The problem: too few English programs, mostly bachelor’s when students want master’s, and no online options,” it said.
Brazil’s master’s programs saw the highest demand and growth among Latin American destinations since 2023, but at the bachelor’s level Brazil does not yet offer any English-taught programs.
Meanwhile Mexico, which has the second highest volume of English-taught programs, saw a 26% decline in interest in the past year. Across the region, the report identified limited traction in TNE opportunities or in institutions rising in global rankings.
To address these issues and share in the growth seen in Asia and MENA, Latin American universities must strengthen English-taught capacity, invest in new, globally relevant programs and build stronger links to the labour market, Baldacchino advised.
“By attracting qualified faculty, securing funding for innovation, and ensuring graduates can find employment locally and regionally, Latin American institutions can begin transforming their education systems into engines of both internationalisation and economic development, mirroring the pathways that have proven successful in Asia and MENA,” he said.
