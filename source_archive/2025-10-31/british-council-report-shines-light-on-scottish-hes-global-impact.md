The report sets out Scotland’s position in the higher education landscape, noting its long tradition of elite institutions, history of world-class research and international partnerships, which the British Council said were “crucial for Scotland’s universities”.
Scotland’s reputation for strong graduate outcomes were also highlighted. The report noted that according to HESA’s most recent graduate outcomes survey, which looked at 2022/23 data, almost nine in 10 (87%) of international graduates from Scottish universities are in either employment or have gone on to further study 15 months after leaving university.
Scotland’s Higher Education: Partnering
for
Global Impact
launched this week to coincide with the British Council’s Going Global conference. It underscored Scotland as a hub for international education, pointing out that over 70,000 international students from more than 150 countries study at Scottish universities.
It said that Scotland’s 19 universities, in a country of under six million people, helped graduates to engage directly with employers across many different industries from tech start-ups to multinational corporations.
Last year, Scotland launched its Migration Service
platform
, which gives information and advice for international students who are thinking about staying in Scotland after they graduate. It is also open to employers in the country who would like to hire international workers.
Speaking to
The PIE News
at the Going Global conference, University of St Andrews principle Sally Mapstone said she thought Scotland’s four-year degree model was “hugely appealing” to students because it allowed them too “explore and take different routes” during their program. “That is a very distinctive aspect of the Scottish system, particularly in comparison to other parts of the UK,” she said.
“We know that employers like students who are flexible, adaptable, can multitask, can work with different types of material, can work individually and in groups, and the nature of the Scottish higher education system very much plays to all of those aspects,” she said. “We certainly find from my own institution’s perspective that that is what is really attractive to international students.”

Head of education at the British Council Harish Lokhun said he hoped the report would “pave the way for global connections and partnerships that will thrive for years to come.”
“We help connect Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland, through the power of education and the arts. Our universities are at the heart of this work,” he said.
Director education at the British Council Maddalaine Ansell told The PIE that Scotland was “an outstandingly beautiful country” that had “amazing universities”.
“I really hope that the people who come here will go on to find ways to collaborate with Scotland and promote Scottish education globally,” she said at a launch event for the report at Scotland House in London.
Meanwhile, Scotland’s minister for higher and further education, Ben MacPherson, said: “Our higher education sector is working in partnership to maintain and enhance Scotland’s position as a world leader in international education, research, and knowledge exchange, and this report demonstrates the benefits of strengthening global connections.”
