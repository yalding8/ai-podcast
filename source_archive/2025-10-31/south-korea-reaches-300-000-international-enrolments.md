International student enrolments in South Korea surpassed 300,000 for the first time this August, with more than a third of students coming from Vietnam, according to government immigration data.
“Korea’s rise as a study destination isn’t happening by accident… After the pandemic, many students in Asia began looking for good-quality education closer to home, and Korea fits that bill perfectly,” director of IES Abroad’s Seoul centre Kyuseok Kim told
The PIE.
“Universities here have expanded English-taught programs, strengthened global partnerships, and actively recruited beyond their traditional markets,” said Kim, adding that Korea’s cultural appeal – from K-pop to K-beauty – had made the destination more visible and aspirational.
The data showed nearly three-quarters of international students were enrolled in university degree programs, with the remaining quarter taking Korean language courses and a small number holding foreign language training visas.
Behind Vietnam, Chinese students comprised 28% of the total, followed by smaller proportions of Uzbek, Mongolian and Nepalese students.
The number of international students at South Korean institutions has been steadily rising in recent years, largely driven by government policies including the launch of its “Study Korea 300K” initiative in 2023 – a goal it set out to achieve by 2027.
Under the strategy, the government eased financial requirements for D-2 student visas, expanded the hours students can work alongside their studies and lengthened the window for graduates to secure employment after finishing their studies.
What’s more, the government pursued more targeted recruitment in Southeast and Central Asia and relaxed regulations allowing universities to create new English-taught programs and better support systems for international students.
“Reaching the 300,000 milestone ahead of schedule will be a big symbolic win,” said Kim, placing the destination on par with the likes of Japan and Singapore.
“The next challenge is sustainability,” he warned: “long-term success will depend on how well students are supported academically, socially, and professionally after they arrive”.
As South Korea’s international student population has grown, the country has faced
mounting pressure
to address employability challenges experienced by international students who complain of employers’ lack of knowledge about visa rules, job codes and wage thresholds.
A
recent survey
of more than 800 international students found that over nine in 10 hoped to stay and work in Korea after completing their studies.

Kyuseok Kim, IES Abroad
South Korea’s rise is indicative of a wider trend of Asian education
“powerhouses”
becoming more appealing to international students turning away from traditional destinations perceived as increasingly unaffordable and restrictive.
This year, Seoul took the
top position
in Qs’s Best Student City Rankings, overtaking former frontrunner London which ranked number one for the previous six years.
Notwithstanding the growth, recent Studyportals
data
revealed a 15% dip in demand for South Korean institutions at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level over the past two years, though commentators do not expect this to continue.
“Korea’s overall momentum is still strong, especially as traditional study destinations in the West become more restrictive and expensive,” said Kim, adding the appeal of Korea’s safety, affordability and cultural vibrancy would likely continue attracting international students.
