Monash University Malaysia will partner with TRX City, developer of Malaysia’s new international financial district, the Tun Razak Exchange, to deliver its RM2.8 billion (USD $1bn) local investment into a new Monash campus, as it looks to deepen its engagement in the ASEAN region.
The campus is set to open in 2032, with eventual capacity for 22,500 students and 1,700 staff. A statement from the university outlined the “cutting-edge research centres in energy transition, health, AI, and data science” that the campus will boast, located in Kuala Lumpur’s financial district.
Monash University’s vice-chancellor and president Sharon Pickering made the announcement in Kuala Lumpur alongside Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Malaysia’s minister of higher education, Zambry Abd Kadir.
“Showcasing Australia’s best in class higher education sector overseas is a huge opportunity for Australian jobs and investment,” said Albanese.
“But it’s also an important opportunity to extend deep connections in our region and right around the world. That’s exactly what we’re seeing with this investment from Monash for a new campus in Malaysia: students learning from one of Australia’s leading international universities right here in the heart of Kuala Lumpur.”
Albanese’s comments come as he visits Kuala Lumpur for the 20th East Asia Summit and the 5th ASEAN-Australia Summit.
The future campus is being delivered in addition to the current Malaysia campus, with programs and services there continuing uninterrupted.
The financial commitment making the new campus possible stems from the success of Monash University Malaysia – which was established in 1998 as Malaysia’s first foreign university campus – with additional financial support coming from Monash University Australia.
We’re opening the doors for future investment in Australia and Malaysia.
For 70 years, Australia and Malaysia have shared a close relationship.
With today's signing of new trade and education agreements, our relationship takes another step forward.
Because when our region…

“More than 35 extra courses will be offered at the campus in priority fields vital to Malaysia and the future global workforce such as; digitisation, AI and cyber security, climate change and sustainability, healthcare and digital health, semiconductor and advanced manufacturing, banking and finance,” the university’s statement read.
Meanwhile, Azmar Talib, CEO of TRX City said its partnership with Monash University “strengthens Malaysia’s competitiveness and connectivity with ASEAN through talent development”.
“Monash University Malaysia’s city campus will enrich TRX’s diverse community and nurture the next generation of global thinkers,” said Talib.
Adeeba Kamarulzaman, president and pro vice-chancellor of Monash University Malaysia set out plans to deliver “world-class education at scale with an ASEAN futures focus on digital transformation, health, sustainability and green energy, and urban development.”
“Our growth-driven investment will ensure we continue to deliver a world-class learning environment for students,” she added.
According to the university’s statement, Monash University Malaysia’s investment is expected to contribute $6.5AUD billion (RM19.1 bn) to the local economy over the next decade “through direct investment and broader economic impacts across infrastructure, innovation, workforce, students and community”.
The news comes as Australian universities are being encouraged by federal government to engage with Southeast Asia. The renewed focus on Southeast Asia reflects
Invested: Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040
– a plan to deepen ties between Australia and Southeast Asia in key areas such as education, agriculture and resources.
Under the government’s
National Planning Level
(NPL), which limits the number of new international students providers may enrol annually, public universities can seek to expand their individual enrolment allocations by evidencing stronger engagement with Southeast Asia.
