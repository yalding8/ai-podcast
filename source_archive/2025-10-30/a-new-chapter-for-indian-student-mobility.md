Over the last decade, India has emerged as one of the largest sources of international students in the world. Countries such as Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand have built entire education recruitment strategies around India’s student population. But the landscape is now changing rapidly and significantly.
For years, international universities and colleges enjoyed predictable growth from the Indian market. Canadian colleges, for example, enrolled thousands of students each intake, while Australian universities consistently relied on strong numbers from India to sustain their international programs. But today, several of these institutions are struggling to meet their intake targets, with some reporting fewer than half the usual number of student arrivals.
Why this sudden shift? The answer lies in a combination of external policy changes and internal socio-economic transformation in India.
On the external front, immigration and visa policies have tightened in several countries. Canada has introduced new caps and stricter work permit pathways. Australia has also revised post-study work rights and raised entry requirements. The UK has made adjustments to its Graduate Route visa, and New Zealand continues to follow a more selective approach to student intake. Together, these shifts have made the dream of studying abroad less straightforward and more uncertain.
But the real story is also unfolding within India. Indian families are changing. This is a generation of parents who often have one child, live in financial comfort, and value security and quality of life. Many already have the home, the car, and the stability they once hoped to achieve through sending their child abroad. If world-class education is accessible at home, they no longer feel the same urgency to send their children overseas at any cost.
Students, too, are more informed and demanding of clear value. Gen Z students compare return on investment, visa stability, employability outcomes, and global exposure before making decisions. For them, a university is not just a place to study – it’s a career platform. If that platform looks uncertain, they pause.

This evolving mindset means international institutions can no longer rely on old recruitment playbooks. Generic marketing campaigns, mass agent tie-ups, and short-term outreach are losing effectiveness. To succeed, universities need to understand India deeply, build trust at the family level, and offer transparent pathways with real outcomes.
That’s where Landmark Global Learning brings a different approach. With nearly two decades of experience, Landmark has built one of India’s strongest networks for responsible student recruitment. We focus on building authentic relationships, ensuring the right student reaches the right program, and creating long-term collaborations with institutions that are serious about India.
The international education scenario is undoubtedly shifting. But within this shift lies a powerful opportunity for universities ready to adapt and for organisations that can bridge aspirations with outcomes.
India will continue to be a key player in the global education landscape. The winners will be those who evolve with it, not those who simply rely on what worked in the past.
