Geopolitical tension, challenges to the fundamental role of universities and economic insecurity all create uncertainty while demand for higher education is increasing and disruptive new technologies present both opportunity and challenge.
This British Council’s annual
Going Global
event aims to provide a strategic forum for leaders in international education to discuss these issues with peers. Never has the conference been more needed. Some 450 education leaders from around the world will participate in the conversation as Going Global returns to London for the first time in 10 years.
The three themes of the conference – resilience, values, and innovation – have been chosen to reflect the essential qualities the sector will need not only to survive but to continue to create, curate and share knowledge with the intention of improving the lives of millions around the world.
Conflict has significantly affected tertiary education in the last few years. In 2023 more than 10,000 students, teachers and academics were injured or killed, a 20% increase on previous years. Many others were forced to flee their homes, seeking to further their careers in host countries – which have themselves become over-stretched.
Scholarship schemes and international partnerships have played an important role in supporting displaced students and academics, and these success stories need to be told. There is, however, a risk that a lost generation of young people will not be equipped to rebuild the economic, political, educational, and health infrastructures of their home countries post-conflict. It is important to learn lessons from recent experience to build a resilient global system able to support countries during and post-conflict.
Liberal values that underpinned many tertiary education systems are also coming under threat as geopolitical tensions increase around the world. Institutions are struggling to establish clear guidelines for dialogue and debate on campus, particularly around race and gender, with free speech seen by some as being in opposition to the promotion of inclusion and the creation of safe spaces.
It is critical that universities and colleges develop strategies to consolidate their role as strong civic institutions, defending freedom of speech and providing evidence for highly politicised debate, particularly in areas like climate change, as well as defending plans for tackling discrimination and removing barriers to access for marginalised and disadvantaged groups.

Given the enormity of the challenge, innovation is paramount. We must offer students flexible learning pathways throughout their lives, adapting curricula to develop the skills and knowledge required for new jobs, and harnessing technology.
Artificial intelligence, data science, and automation present both opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to enhance current models of teaching and learning. It can also support research and accelerate scientific discovery by analysing large datasets, identifying trends, and generating new insights. Yet it also raises security and ethical concerns, with policy and regulation struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advancement.
Transnational Education (TNE) has already proved itself to be a huge driver for increased access to education. China alone hosts more than 47 branch campuses and more than 500,000 TNE students, with further hubs in Malaysia, Singapore, UAE and Sri Lanka.
Globally, several models have been developed over the last 20 years, including international branch campuses, joint degree programmes, blended and distance learning opportunities and fully online programmes but there is more work to be done to develop new models for sustainable TNE at scale.
The forum recognises that no single institution or country can solve our problems alone; stronger international collaborations and equitable partnerships will be essential for success.
