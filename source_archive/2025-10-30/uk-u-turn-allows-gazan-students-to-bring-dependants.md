The UK department for education has
said
it will now allow eligible Gazan PhD and master’s students on fully funded scholarships to bring their partners and children with them to the UK.
Dependants were not included in the government’s
original plans
supporting Gazan students on the Chevening scheme and other government-funded scholarships to study in the UK, announced this August.
The government has said the policy will be implemented on a “case-by-case basis” due to the fact its delivery is reliant on several factors outside of its control.
The policy reversal comes after several students said they would not be able to travel to the UK to take up their university place while leaving their children behind.
“Students coming from Gaza to the UK have suffered an appalling ordeal after two years of conflict,” a government spokesperson told
The PIE
.
“They have endured unimaginable hardship but can now begin to rebuild their lives through studying in our world-class universities.”
“That is why we are supporting the evacuation of dependants of students on scholarships who are eligible to study here under the immigration rules on a case-by-case basis.”

Dependants will have to meet immigration rule requirements, including having veritable funding to cover living costs – up to £6,120 for those studying outside London, or £7,605 for those studying in London.
Under the evacuation scheme, the Home Office has put in place systems to issue expedited visas with biometric tests conducted before students’ arrival to ensure they can begin their studies during the autumn term and no later than December 31.
However, according to the BBC, six students due to start master’s courses at the university of Glasgow this year were not evacuated after it became clear they would arrive too late to start their courses. It is understood the university will honour the students’ places if they are able to arrive in time for future enrolments.
The government warned that the situation on the ground in Gaza remained “extremely challenging” and that the journeys of students and dependants coming to the UK could not be guaranteed.
They added that timlines were “uncertain” and children travelling without their parents could come up against safeguarding impediments.
While the initial plan covered approximately 40 students, it is understood at least 75 students from Gaza have now come to the UK. The call to evacuate all UK scholarship students from Gaza without exception was backed by over 100 parliamentarians.
It is unclear what will replace the current scheme, which is in place until the end of the year. Given the potential for alternative exit routes to open from Gaza, the government has said it will keep the scope and delivery of support under review.
The news comes as more UK universities are pausing student recruitment from countries seen as high risk, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as institutions brace for the government’s tightening of visa compliance metrics.
